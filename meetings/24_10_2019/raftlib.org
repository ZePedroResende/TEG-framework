* ScalaPipe
* StreamJIT
* TBB (Threading building block)
* Communicationbetween kernels via streams is accounted for by edge weights(weights potentially calculated us-ing information from libraries likehwloc[13]). More advanced partitioning algorithms can addadditional degrees of freedom in the form of matching kernels to specific processing resources
